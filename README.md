# UdacityAlumni
Udacity Alumni Android App from web app started by Ryan Collins https://github.com/udacityalumni/udacity-alumni-fe

The app will feature curated capstone projects from Udacity alumni including apps on the Google Play Store. It will also display alumni accomplishments and profiles, career opportunities, and meetups.

Udacity's projects are great for improving your skills as a developer but once you've finished your ND you may still have little to no experience working on group projects. Contributing to this project is a valuable opportunity for you to show employers that you have experience working as a group and possess the teamwork skills needed to succeed in the workplace.

If you are a Udacity ND graduate, or current or prospective student you are welcome to contribute! Read the instructions below on how to get started.
